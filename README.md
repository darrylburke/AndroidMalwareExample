# Android Malware Example

this project is a security proof of concept that shows the ability of simple android SDK features to implement a Malware feature set on Android phones.

*Note:  This program is not intended to be stealthy or use bugs in the androind OS/SDK to hid the application or the install of it. This software should not be used in the wild, or without the express concent of the device owner/operator*

The Android Malware Example demonstrates the following abilites:
1. Using a Command and Control server to send commands to the device

2. Use of encryption for the following:
  1. SSL communications with the server
  2. SSL certificate validation to prevent SSL MiTM attacks
  3. encrypt files before sending to the server
  4. Ransomware feature to encrypt files on the device SD card
  
3. Background service which restarts on phone boot

4. SMS listener for inbound command activation

5. The following Malware Features are implemented and send thier data to the CNC Server
  *1. Get Wifi Network information*
  *2. Get Phone information*
  *3. Get Accounts configured on the device*
  *4. Get all Contacts on the phone *
  *5. Get the Phone Logs *
  *6. Get SMS Logs*
  *7. Get Bluetooth device information*
  *8. Get System Logs*
  *9. Get GPS Location*
  *10. Get list of files on the SD Card*
  *11. Send a File from the device to the CNC Server*
  *12. download a file from a URL and place it on the phone.*
  *13. Encrypt/Decrypt all files on the SD card with a password (Ransomware)*
  *14. Record audio on the device *
  *15. Get list of installed Applications.*
  *16. Send and SMS message to a phone number. *
  *17. Configure a delay to check back with the CNC server*
  
6. The following features are not implemented due to recent changes in the SDK which prevent them
  1. access to browser history via the SDK
  2. SDK access to the Camera in a way which hides the UI and takes a picture
